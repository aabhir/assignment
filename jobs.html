      <h1>Front-end Developer(SKILLS NEEDED)</h1>
  <p>


    HTML – All code in a web application is eventually translated to HTML. It’s the language that web browsers understand and use to display information to users. A web developer’s understanding of HTML is analogous to a carpenter’s understanding of a screwdriver. It’s so important and necessary that it’s often assumed for employment.
</p>
    <p>CSS – By itself, HTML is quite plain. HTML does provide some basic style options, but to build a good frontend, developers must have experience with CSS. CSS provides the paint, templates, glitter, buttons, tassel, lights, and many other things that can be used to improve the presentation of a web page. CSS is so commonly used that languages have been built to make writing CSS easier. </p>

    <p>JavaScript – If you could only learn one language in your lifetime, you’d be well-advised to choose JavaScript. Though it’s not exclusively a frontend language, that’s where it’s most commonly used. JavaScript is a language that is run on a client machine, i.e. a user’s computer. This means that JavaScript can be used to program fast, intuitive and fun user experiences, without forcing a user to refresh their web page. Drag-and-drop, infinite-scroll and videos that come to life on a web page can all be programmed with JavaScript.

    Ruby – Ruby is a programming language created to be fun and efficient. Ruby syntax is easy to read, even for people who don’t know Ruby. Ruby was thrust into the mainstream thanks to Ruby on Rails, which is a framework (built with Ruby) for building web applications. Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular web development tools for small businesses and startups.
</p>
    Python – Much like Ruby, Python is known in part for its readability. A popular web development framework, Django, also makes Python a popular choice for building web applications. Dropbox was built with – and still uses – Python to run much of its server-side code. Python can be used for everything Ruby can.
<p>
    SQL – SQL is a universal database query language. SQL is used to interact with databases, which are a part of every backend web application. No matter what language or framework you choose to build your web application, you will likely use SQL, or some abstraction of it, to interact with the database.
